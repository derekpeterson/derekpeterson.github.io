Via [the Ten Rules of a Zen Programmer](http://www.zenprogrammer.org/en/the10rulesofazenprogrammer.html), a helpful reminder:

> So… why exactly are you special? Because you had the luck to be born in a Western country? Because you can code? No, there is nothing special about it. You can let go of your ego and live freely. Enjoy the colors and the smell of flowers. Don’t be too sad when the winter arrives and don’t be too happy when spring comes back. It is just a flow. Keep it in mind when somebody denies your application. Because no company is so special that you need to be worried about the job.

Don't take yourself so seriously.
