<a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/world-cup/75796/enough-already-the-anti-american-conspiracy-theories">Enough Already With The Anti-American Conspiracy Theories | The New Republic</a><br/><p>Alex Massie, a Scot, bemoans American complaining about World Cup officials and FIFA&#8217;s unnecessary opacity, but somehow forgets that the Irish are <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hsUIvAPLQAwj1_aUK8zkz0rh_dswD9GE6R780" target="_blank">still</a> complaining about France&#8217;s fraudulent World Cup berth. He also somehow missed the annual complaining of NBA fans about rotten officiating in favor of LeBron, Kobe, and other superstars, which makes our tendency to view these things in terms of politics more understandable. Seeing two goals called back because of a phantom call and a false offsides, in consecutive games, is a lot like watching Kobe walk with the ball, have his shot blocked, and end up at the foul line. In isolation, a bad call looks like a bad call. In tandem, these bad calls look fishy, to say the least. Or, the Scot can just call us paranoid. That works, too.</p>
