<p>I finally got around to updating the theme of this thing. Plus, I switched over to <a href="http://www.derekpetey.com" target="_blank">my new domain</a> in the process because maintaining the information on my personal site was a pain. Hopefully having it be prettier (simple, clean, responsive) and represent my main Web presence will make me more likely to post here. Or, it won&#8217;t, and I&#8217;ll still have a prettier site. It looks Bootstrap-y, but is in fact all me. I need to design a logo for myself.</p>
