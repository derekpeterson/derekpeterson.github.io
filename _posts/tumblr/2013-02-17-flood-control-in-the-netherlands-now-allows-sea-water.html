<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/arts/design/flood-control-in-the-netherlands-now-allows-sea-water-in.html?pagewanted=all">Flood Control in the Netherlands Now Allows Sea Water In - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>I agree with the currently popular idea that we should look to the Dutch for guidance when it comes to protecting vulnerable areas from flooding. At the same time, it seems naïve to suggest that the government should do so in part because of the cost savings.

</p><blockquote>American politicians, including those who argued to cut back on money for preventive measures after Sandy, might want to see how the Dutch have managed to improve public life, public space and the landscape at a fraction of the billions American taxpayers pay out for repairing hurricane damage.</blockquote>

This ignores the strong counter-incentives that politicians have for outlaying the money necessary to complete such projects: namely what&#8217;s-in-it-for-me syndrome and the recipients of recovery money after a disaster. For the former, politicians from non-vulnerable areas (i.e. most of the country) get little out of these plans except for flak about supporting Washington&#8217;s spending habits. This country isn&#8217;t bound by the common fate as is the Netherlands, &#8220;where 60 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product is produced below sea level.&#8221; Meanwhile, on the latter, the contracting companies that specialize in responding to disasters stand to lose a lot of money without those disasters, and they have powerful lobbying operations. That fraction referred to in the quotation above comes out of someone&#8217;s pocket, after all.

That is not to say that I disagree, but instead that I am skeptical of our system&#8217;s ability to transition to a more rational approach.
