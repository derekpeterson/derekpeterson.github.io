<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/georgepacker/2010/09/a-date-that-will-live-in-oblivion.html">A Date That Will Live in Oblivion</a><br/><p>This is an excellent and honest post on a shameless claim to a meaningless milestone by President Obama. It reminds me of this <a href="http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/351604/august-26-2010/richard-engel/" target="_blank">Stephen Colbert interview of Richard Engel</a>, the White House communications specialist who moonlights as a foreign correspondent for NBC News, that I saw last night and which made me feel sick. The extent to which our major news media have fused with our government &#8212; especially as showcased with the Iraq War, from before its start to its &#8220;finish&#8221; &#8212; is disgusting.</p>
