<p>This made me laugh:</p>

<p><quote>"I guess you&#8217;ve got a fracture all right. I&#8217;ll wrap you up and don&#8217;t bounce your head around." He bandaged, his hands moving very fast and the bandage coming taut and sure. "All right, good luck, and Vive la France."</quote></p>

<p>"He&#8217;s an American," one of the other captains said.</p>

<p>"I thought you said he was a Frenchman. He talks French," the captain said. "I&#8217;ve known him before. I always thought he was French."</p>
