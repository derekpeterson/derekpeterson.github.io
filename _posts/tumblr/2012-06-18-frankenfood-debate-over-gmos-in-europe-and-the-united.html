<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2012/06/frankenfood_debate_over_gmos_in_europe_and_the_united_states_.single.html">Frankenfood debate over GMOs in Europe and the United States. - Slate Magazine</a><br/><p>Europe is coming to accept GMO foods as America enters its own period of hysterics over them.</p>

<p>Two notes on the politics:<br/>
1.) I understand that GMO sounds creepy, but practically it&#8217;s just a more technical and precise way to accomplish the same thing as cross-breeding and hybridization.<br/>
2.) The intellectual property apparatus that governs crops is among the worst IP regimes out there, which is saying something.</p>
