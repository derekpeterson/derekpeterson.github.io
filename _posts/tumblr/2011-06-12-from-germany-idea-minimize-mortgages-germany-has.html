title: 'From: Germany Idea: Minimize Mortgages Germany has one of the lowest homeownership
  rates among wealthy nations—around 46 percent, vs. two-thirds in the U.S.—and also
  one of the most stable housing markets. Prices of owner-occupied housing in Germany
  are up 9 percent since 2003, according to the Association of German Pfandbrief Banks.
  What’s the German formula? Housing is less vulnerable to booms and busts because
  only highly qualified buyers can get a mortgage. Down payments are usually at least
  20 percent, often 40 percent. Mortgage interest is not tax-deductible, as it is
  in the U.S., which also discourages excessive leverage. Germans are justly proud
  of their Pfandbrief, an ultrasafe bond whose collateral is a set of standardized
  mortgages whose loan-to-value ratio can’t exceed 60 percent. The bank that sells
  a mortgage-backed Pfandbrief to investors retains all the risk of default, giving
  it the incentive to underwrite cautiously. The lesson for the U.S.? Tougher lending
  rules would help lower the risk of another housing crash. And in the long run, Americans
  may have to accept a lower homeownership rate to pay for taking the boom and bust
  out of the market.'
