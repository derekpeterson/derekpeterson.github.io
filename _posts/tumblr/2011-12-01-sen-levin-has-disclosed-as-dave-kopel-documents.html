title: Sen. Levin has disclosed, as Dave Kopel documents, that “it was the Obama administration
  which told Congress to remove the language in the original bill which exempted American
  citizens and lawful residents from the detention power,” on the ground it would
  unduly restrict the decision-making of Executive Branch officials. In other words,
  Obama officials wanted the flexibility to militarily detain even U.S. citizens if
  they were so inclined, and are angry that this bill purports to limit their actions.
