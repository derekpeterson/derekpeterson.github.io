<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/business/economy/15view.html?_r=1&src=busln">Economic View - Why Free Parking Comes at a Price - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>Tyler Cowen &#8212; an economist at George Mason and a blogger at Marginal Revolution &#8212; explains why the paradigm that requires free parking is bad economics and worse policy. A good introductory read on the topic for people who may hear that and think, &#8220;What? But we need free parking!&#8221;</p>
