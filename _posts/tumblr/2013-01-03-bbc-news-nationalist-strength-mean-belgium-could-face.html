<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-20888957">BBC News - Nationalist strength mean Belgium could face break up</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good look at the push by the Flemish to split Belgium in two parts (Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia). Aside from my love of Belgium (my favorite country in Europe), this fascinates me because it is the rich part pushing to separate from the poor part, whereas in the United States separatist movements tend to thrive mostly in the poorer South. On another note, some of the Walloons in the video express concern about losing Flemish money in the event of a split, but I wonder if that&#8217;s even the case given the European Union&#8217;s transfer payments to poorer members (e.g., Poland, Romania).</p>
