<a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37179168/ns/today-today_fashion_and_beauty/">New Miss USA crowned after gown stumble - Beauty Pageants</a><br/><p>Rima Fakih, an Arab-American from Dearborn, won the pageant and said, &#8220;I believe that birth control is just like every other medication even though it&#8217;s a controlled substance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Runner-up Miss Oklahoma said, &#8220;I&#8217;m a huge believer in states&#8217; rights. I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s so wonderful about America. So I think it&#8217;s perfectly fine for Arizona to create that law.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right-wingers attribute Miss Oklahoma&#8217;s loss to a liberal bias against her informed answer. Clearly.</p>
