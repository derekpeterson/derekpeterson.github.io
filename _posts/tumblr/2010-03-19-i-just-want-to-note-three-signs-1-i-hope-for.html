  I just want to note three signs:
  1.) “I hope for 100% unemployment in Congress! Bachmann 2012”
  This makes no sense: Michelle Bachmann now has a job in Congress, and this guy wants her to continue having one. He also wants 100% unemployment in Congress. This is a logical contradiction. (With EFSQ, everything he thinks is therefore correct, but I doubt he was going for that.)
  2.) “Obama, I want an oompa-loompa”
  Self-explanatory hilarity.
  3.) “Tom Petty stole my Juicy Fruit”
  Ditto.
