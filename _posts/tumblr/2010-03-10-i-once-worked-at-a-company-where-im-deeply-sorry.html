title: I once worked at a company where “I’m deeply sorry for not picking up the phone
  sooner!” was the required telephone greeting. We were coached in orientation to
  use a neighbor’s phone to call our own desk phone to learn the exact length of one
  ring, so that we could practice the timing of picking up the phone partway through
  its first ring — not soon enough to freak out the person on the other end.
