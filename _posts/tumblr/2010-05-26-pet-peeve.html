<p>When people write parenthetical statements without paying attention to parallel structure. An <a href="http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/25/three-things-ive-learned-about-frugal-travel-and-the-things-i-didnt-do/" target="_blank">example</a>: &#8220;As valuable as the Internet is, nothing will save you more money — or make travel as meaningful — as actual people.&#8221; That should read &#8220;[&#8230;] will save you as much money &#8212; or make travel as meaningful &#8212; as actual people&#8221; or &#8220;[&#8230;] will you save you more money &#8212; or make travel more meaningful &#8212; than actual people.&#8221; Neglecting the required structure here creates a nonsensical sentence: &#8220;As valuable as the Internet is, nothing will save you more money as actual people.&#8221;</p>
