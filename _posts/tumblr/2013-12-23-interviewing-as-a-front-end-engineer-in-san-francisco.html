<blockquote>
  <p>Overall, my experience was quite good. Some of these companies have a reputation for their excruciating interviews, but what I went through was not nearly as bad as the stories I&#8217;d heard. Everyone was nice, everyone was professional, and if I didn&#8217;t know the answer to something, I never felt belittled. Most of the time it just seemed like a simple conversation about technology between two people discussing the best way to solve a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This basically sums up my criticism. The overwhelming majority of my interview questions were logical puzzles, generic coding challenges, and algorithm design problems â€” things that are necessary but nowhere near sufficient.</p>
