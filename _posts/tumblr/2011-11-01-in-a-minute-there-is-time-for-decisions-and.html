  In a minute there is time
  For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

  For I have known them all already, known them all:
  Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
  I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
  I know the voices dying with a dying fall
  Beneath the music from a farther room.
       So how should I presume?
