<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21536656">A numerical French obsession: Twenty times twenty | The Economist</a><br/><p>This is an entertaining read for a Francophone (and moderate Francophile). Even better is noting that the author failed to mention that <i>quatre-vingts</i> and <i>quatre-vingts-dix</i> is idiomatic to French French, rather than being standard in all varieties of French. In Belgium and Switzerland, <i>octante</i> and <i>nonante</i> are used for eighty and ninety (as well as <i>septante</i> for seventy), respectively. Damn, it feels good to be a pedant.</p>
