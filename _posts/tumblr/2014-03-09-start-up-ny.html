<a href="http://startup.ny.gov/">START-UP NY</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>There’s a new advantage to doing business in New York. A big one. START-UP NY, Governor Cuomo’s groundbreaking initiative, is transforming communities across the state into tax-free sites for new and expanding businesses. Now, businesses can operate 100% tax-free for 10 years. No income tax, business, corporate, state or local taxes, sales and property taxes, or franchise fees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No taxes for ten years, eh?</p>
