title: 'There may be no white America and no black America, no blue-state America
  and no red-state America, but one thing is clear: There is a young America and there
  is an old America, and they donâ€™t form a community of interest. One takes from the
  other. The federal government spends $480 billion on Medicare and $68 billion on
  education. Prescription drugs: $62 billion. Head Start: $8 billion. Across the board,
  the money flows not to helping the young grow up, but helping the old die comfortably.
  According to a 2009 Brookings Institution study, "The United States spends 2.4 times
  as much on the elderly as on children, measured on a per capita basis, with the
  ratio rising to 7 to 1 if looking just at the federal budget."'

<p>This is the article from a major publication that I have been waiting for some time to see written. The country is starving its children for the sake of the older generations, all while the older generations demand more for themselves at the expense of the youth.</p>
