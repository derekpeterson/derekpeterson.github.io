title: Want an espresso to go at Ninth Street Espresso? Forget it. The baristas there
  believe it should be drunk immediately from a warm ceramic cup. Want a cappuccino
  made from single-origin beans at Kaffe 1668? Sorry, you’ll be told, but milk would
  overpower the subtle flavors of the coffee. Wonder why the barista pulled and tossed
  out two shots of espresso before she served you yours? She was making sure it was
  perfect, the coffee evenly tamped, the water temperature ideal for the particular
  beans, the timing just right.

<p>Wonderful things happen when the coffee itself (or the drink or the food) becomes the focus of the transaction between buyer and seller.</p>
