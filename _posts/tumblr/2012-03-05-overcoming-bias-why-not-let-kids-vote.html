<a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/03/why-not-let-kids-vote.html">Overcoming Bias : Why Not Let Kids Vote?</a><br/><p>There really is no good reason. If people are concerned about kids&#8217; competence as voters, then they ought to push for competency tests for voting. If they worry about parents&#8217; having a disproportionate effect on outcomes, then they ought to consider imposing an age maximum as well to protect against elderly voters&#8217; ability to protect their own interests no matter the cost.</p>
