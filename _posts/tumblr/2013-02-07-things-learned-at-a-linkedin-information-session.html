<p>[This post strays from my typical link-sharing approach to Tumblr.]

The presentation focused on the company&#8217;s culture and, in particular, how the presenter sees LinkedIn embodying principles that he gleened from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukiyabashi_Jiro" target="_blank">Jiro Ono</a>, the master sushi chef and focus of the documentary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiro_Dreams_of_Sushi" target="_blank">Jiro Dreams of Sushi</a>. Here are the principles:

</p><ol><li>Become an expert</li>
<li>Never stop learning, practicing your craft, and evolving</li>
<li>Surround yourself with experts and learn from them</li>
<li>Innovate</li>
<li>Have a stand: develop a value system and stick to it in the face of adversity</li>
<li>Remember that it&#8217;s about people</li>
</ol>

One of the main takeaways that applies to all of these was that LinkedIn encourages its employees to pursue what they&#8217;re passionate about within the company in order to improve the company&#8217;s end-products and user experience.

I also learned a few things that I found interesting:

<ul><li>No one at LinkedIn stays on the same team for more than 11 months, and (voluntarily) switching teams sooner than that is the norm.</li>
<li>LinkedIn shuts down users&#8217; updates to their network when they indicate that they are searching for a job (a nifty bit of user-centric design that I hadn&#8217;t known about before).</li>
<li>Everyone has quarterly reviews for promotion, and it isn&#8217;t unusual to be promoted after six months or so in a position.</li>
<li>Engineers can refuse to build something (i.e. they are a central part of the product team): the presenter told us about a time when he took a design to a developer and was told, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not going to build that because it&#8217;s not cool.&#8221; (This one was my favorite.)</li>
</ul>

All in all, I was impressed with the culture. This is understatement, but it seems like a cool place to work.
