<a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/2012/7-reasons-we-feel-so-old/">7 Reasons We Feel So Old | Thought Catalog</a><br/><p>These hit way too close to home. I want to nod and say, &#8220;Yeah, definitely. Isn&#8217;t it great?&#8221;, but instead I find myself wanting to skip ahead and ignore them all. I don&#8217;t understand how to balance being as mature as I am (I have a job, wake up at 6 am of my own accord, and read the <em>New Yorker</em>) with being as childish as I am (I still dream about what I&#8217;ll be when I grow up, and I don&#8217;t want kids because they would hog 25 years of me-time).</p>
