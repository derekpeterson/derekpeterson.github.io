  <p>So today I experimented with a new way of learning – I wanted to understand what happens when I run a “hello world” program, but I wasn’t at Hacker School. So I wrote down my current understanding and a bunch of questions and asked Twitter!</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s a good thing, too. <a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/7688286/" target="_blank">The result</a> is really cool. Bravo, Internet!</p>
