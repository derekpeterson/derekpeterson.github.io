title: 'But no one knows or cares about “the D”. In fact, I’ve seen other people in
  cities like Dallas call their city “the D”. But “Detroit” is a name with international
  resonance and power. It’s what I call “the power of brand Detroit”, and it is overwhelming.
  Has Cleveland, Buffalo, or any other struggling city gotten one tenth the national
  and international media coverage of Detroit? Did Time magazine set up a “Project
  Toledo”? No. Detroit is simply a city and brand unlike any other, one that has the
  power to grab the eyes of the world. One small example: when I write posts about
  Detroit, my traffic goes up 10x. My piece on Detroit as the new American frontier
  from last summer is still being linked all over the place, including BMW discussion
  boards in Latvia, forums in Sweden, the New York Times, Facebook shares in Japan
  and more. If I wanted to maximize traffic, I’d write about nothing but Detroit.
  Not even my New York City or Chicago posts compete.'
