<p>Reading this New Yorker article about the Church of England&#8217;s battle over female bishops, and the damage done to Pope Benedict&#8217;s invitation to conservative Anglicans to join the Roman Catholic church by his involvement in covering up molestation by priests, I couldn&#8217;t help thinking back to Chappelle&#8217;s Show&#8217;s coverage of the Jedi Council&#8217;s own molestation and cover-up scandal.</p>
