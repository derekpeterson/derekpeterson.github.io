  But the legislation, which would prevent all university law clinics that receive state money from challenging government agencies in court, suing individuals for damages, or raising constitutional challenges, would have serious repercussions at the stateâ€™s three other law schools: at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Loyola University New Orleans, and Southern University in Baton Rouge. Students in their law clinics would be limited in their ability to represent clients in landlord-tenant disputes, contract-fraud, and other cases.

  The four universities would lose all of their state funds if their law clinics violated the proposed law. The bill would also give two legislative committees oversight over law-school clinics.
