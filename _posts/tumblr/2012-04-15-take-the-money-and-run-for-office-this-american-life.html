<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/461/take-the-money-and-run-for-office">Take the Money and Run for Office | This American Life</a><br/><p>This is a particularly excellent episode of &#8220;This American Life&#8221; on money in politics, from elected officials&#8217; full-time jobs as fundraisers to PACs to campaign finance reform.</p>

<p>In it, Russ Feingold makes an interesting point: with elected officials calling up companies and asking for donations, the current system resembles extortion more than bribery.</p>
