<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21560864">The presidency: So, Mitt, what do you really believe? | The Economist</a><br/><p>This relates to an idea that I have been kicking around: that Romney picked Paul Ryan as his running-mate so that Ryan would no longer be in the House to undermine Romney&#8217;s compromises. I know that this thinking casts Occam&#8217;s Razor to the trash-bin, but hear me out.</p>

<p>Romney as the governor of Massachusetts was a nearly non-partisan politician. As a Republican in that state, of course, he had to be. That is beside the point, though, because he did in fact support abortion rights and gun control, create the most ambitious state health-insurance system in the country, and recognize climate change. It seems unlikely that he would have changed his mind so drastically in his early 60s, which leads me to assume, as many do, that he has adopted his current political positions for the sake of gaining his party&#8217;s nomination. To the average person, such pandering seems shameful, but it is de jure for politicans (remember President Obama&#8217;s changes-of-heart on FISA, indefinite detention, and un-provoked attacks on other countries?).</p>

<p>Instead, I imagine that Romney&#8217;s actual positions resemble those of the legitimately moderate Romney who was governor of Massachusetts than his campaign&#8217;s proposals. Hiding those positions makes a lot of sense, then, because who honestly thinks that the Republican party would nominate someone like that to run for president? For him to have any chance of winning the nomination, Romney would have to attach himself to the zeitgeist of the Republican party: xenophobic, reactionary &#8220;conservatism&#8221;. Picking Paul Ryan as his VP represents a logical extension of that strategy.</p>

<p>That is also his brilliant turn. As we already know and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2012/08/27/120827taco_talk_cassidy" title="New Yorker Comment" target="_blank">John Cassidy mentions in this week&#8217;s New Yorker Comment</a>, not satisfied to be an ambitious and respected back-bencher in the GOP, Paul Ryan is willing to sabotage deals that he disagrees with, even ones that have the support of party leaders. This makes his presence in the House a threat to any Republican who would like to work with Democrats to actually solve the country&#8217;s problems (including an arcane, Swiss cheese-like tax system; a bloated defense budget; and rapidly growing health-care costs). If, as I expect, moderate Mitt Romney sees ways to do so (and recognizes that President Obama stands no chance to do the same, given the current state of the Republican party), removing Ryan&#8217;s guaranteed dissent from the picture becomes essential. What better way to do so than to stick him in the White House, where he can do what most Vice Presidents do: nothing except speaking when asked.</p>

<p>There it is: my argument for the existence of a Mitt Romney conspiracy to launch a Trojan horse attack on his own party. Once he officially secures the nomination next week, perhaps we will see clues about this, although I doubt it. Ryan still has time to defect. Likewise, Republican voters could still launch a &#8220;conservative&#8221; challenger, but doing so would probably guarantee the election for Obama, so they would have to grin and bear it.</p>
