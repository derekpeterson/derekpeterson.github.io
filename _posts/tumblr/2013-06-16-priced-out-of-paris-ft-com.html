<p>This article reminds me of something I&#8217;ve occasionally thought about since moving to Seattle. While not itself a global city, it offers amenities and opportunities on par with cities that are (quality, if not quantity-wise when it comes to, say, entertainment).

Its economy, while strong, does not benefit from essential city status, which keeps the rentier class at bay to some extent and housing costs down.</p>
