<a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/">Here's The Thing: - WNYC</a><br/><p>Well, I just found a solid new addition to my podcast rotation: &#8220;Here&#8217;s the Thing, with Alec Baldwin&#8221; from WNYC. New episodes arrive every two weeks, with Baldwin interviewing figures in the entertainment industry.</p>
