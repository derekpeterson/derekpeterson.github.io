<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/comment/2010/11/29/101129taco_talk_hertzberg">Glenn Beck’s George Soros shows : The New Yorker</a><br/><p>A good, short article about Glenn Beck&#8217;s libelous, pathological treatment of George Soros. It&#8217;s good to keep reminders about all of the excellent initiatives in favor of freedom and human rights that Mr. Soros has promoted through the years. Not so much could or will ever be said of Mr. Beck or his employer, Rupert Murdoch.</p>
