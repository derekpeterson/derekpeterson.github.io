title: Because, Mr President, it is not enough to be “supportive” of ending “Don’t
  Ask, Don’t Tell.” When you have the presidency and your party controls both Houses
  of Congress, it’s a matter of having the political will to end it. Not all gay people
  are HRC-fundraisers. Some are even risking their lives every day for this country,
  in uniform, only to be treated like second class human beings and citizens by their
  own government.
