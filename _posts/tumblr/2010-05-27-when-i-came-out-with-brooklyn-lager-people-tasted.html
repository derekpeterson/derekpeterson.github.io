title: When I came out with Brooklyn Lager people tasted it and were kind of repulsed.
  They said, ‘Geez, why don’t you make something like Heineken?’ What they didn’t
  understand was the point was to make flavor in beer. That is what craft brewing
  is all about, about turning people on to flavor in beer and the tremendous range
  of flavors that you can achieve in beers.
