<a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/10/04/thoughts-on-typescript/">Thoughts on TypeScript | NCZOnline</a><br/><p>Excellent post on some of the basic functionality in TypeScript, what&#8217;s great, what isn&#8217;t, and what to expect. That it is an extension of JavaScript and compiles by default directly to vanilla JS says a lot about its merits and about Microsoft&#8217;s transformation.</p>

<p>My thoughts: this is really cool, and I can see how it could be a useful development tool. It also helps that they&#8217;ve got <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/interoperability/archive/2012/10/01/sublime-text-vi-emacs-typescript-enabled.aspx?Redirected=true" target="_blank">support for Sublime Text 2</a> ready to go.</p>
