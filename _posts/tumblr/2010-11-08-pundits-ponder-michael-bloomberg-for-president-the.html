<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/11/15/101115ta_talk_mcgrath">Pundits ponder Michael Bloomberg for President : The New Yorker</a><br/><p>Two thoughts:</p>

<p>1.) Why not Bloomberg as Obama&#8217;s VP pick in 2012?<br/>
2.) As for Bloomberg&#8217;s thought that â€œa third-party candidate could run the government easier than a partisan political President,&#8221; I may agree with him. On that note, though, why not shift to non-partisan presidential elections. Since the president is not in the legislature, this could open up the position to more ideologically balanced candidates than the two-party system does, without destroying the two-party system in the legislature. That could make it more palatable to the parties.</p>
