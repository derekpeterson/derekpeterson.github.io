<a href="http://blog.nodejitsu.com/content-delivery-network-in-node-js">Versions: The Node.js Content Delivery Network — blog.nodejitsu.com</a><br/><blockquote>
<p>Versions allows you to create a small scale content delivery network using Node.js. It
gets its performance by caching file lookups in memory and setting
aggressive caching headers. The fastest request is one that you don&#8217;t have to 
make! The server comes with a wide range of features that most
public paid CDN&#8217;s also support:</p>
<ul><li>Origin pull, the ability to fetch resources from remote servers and cache
them on the server.</li>
<li>Cache Headers, versions will automatically configure cache headers for you.</li>
<li>Advanced &amp; automatic GZIP, It gzips your resources automatically for browsers
that support it (except IE5/6) and detects obfuscated gzip headers as
researched by the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2010/12/pushing-beyond-gzipping/" target="_blank">Yahoo Performance team</a>.</li>
<li>REST API, providing a REST API to manage the server.</li>
<li>Clusters, when ran in clusters it can synchronize configuration and other
details between servers using a Redis engine.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
