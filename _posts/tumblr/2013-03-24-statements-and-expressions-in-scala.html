<p>Interesting!

</p><blockquote>For similar reasons, return statements are unnecessary in Scala, and in fact are discouraged. As in Lisp, the last expression in a block of code is the value of that block of code, and if the block of code is the body of a function, it will be returned by the function.</blockquote>

(via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_%28programming_language%29#Everything_is_an_expression" target="_blank">Scala on Wikipedia</a> because apparently this is how I spend my Sunday afternoons)
