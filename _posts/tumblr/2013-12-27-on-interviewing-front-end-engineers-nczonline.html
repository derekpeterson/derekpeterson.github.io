<a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2013/12/27/on-interviewing-front-end-engineers/">On interviewing front-end engineers | NCZOnline</a><br/><p>A response/follow-up from Nicholas Zakas to <a href="http://www.derekpetey.com/2013/12/23/interviewing-as-a-front-end-engineer-in-san-francisco.html" target="_blank">that blog-post a few days ago about interviewing for front-end positions</a>. I think he&#8217;s absolutely right, and it&#8217;s good to read it from somebody with his stature in the field.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been getting asked more and more about whether or not front-end engineers need to understand computer science algorithms and data structures in order to be hired. My simple answer: no. I don’t see these as necessary prerequisites for people to be successful as front-end engineers. The reason is that these aren’t things most front-end engineers do on a day-to-day basis. Do I use algorithms and data structures? Sometimes, but I usually look up the things I need when I have a need for them. That information is easy to find online and there are always people around who know these topics better than me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In general, I believe interviews should be designed to demonstrate skills that a candidate will be expected to use on a day-to-day basis. It’s easy to pat ourselves on the back and chat about O-notation (which I had never even heard of until about 7 years into my career) or heap sort (the first time I encountered heap sort was during my Google interview), but is that a good indicator of whether or not someone will be successful as a front-end engineer? Absolutely not.</p>
