<p>From Ashley&#8217;s latest email:</p>

<blockquote><h3>Does Anheuser-Busch Make the Best &#8220;Craft&#8221; Beer?</h3>
<p>Consumer Reports has an article out on the &#8220;Best Craft Beers&#8221; in which the editors tasted and rated 23 ales and lagers. Some of their top picks, like Stone IPA, we can&#8217;t really argue with.</p>
<p>But included in their list were some odd &#8220;craft&#8221; choices, such as Blue Moon Belgian White, made by MillerCoors, and Shock Top Wheat IPA, made by Anheuser-Busch InBev. The article acknowledges that &#8220;craft beer&#8221; can be a &#8220;somewhat squishy&#8221; term, but really, is it so squishy that two of the world&#8217;s largest industrial breweries fit into the category?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review. The Brewers Association defines a craft brewery as one that is small (less than six million barrels in annual production), independent (less than 25% owned or controlled by a corporate entity like AB InBev), and traditional (basically, they don&#8217;t water down their beers). We don&#8217;t really think of any of those things when we see this:</p>
<h4>Not so small or traditional</h4>
<p>Still, even though Consumer Reports obviously doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get it,&#8221; this kind of attempt to jump in front of the parade has to be considered progress. When Ashley&#8217;s was founded 30 years ago, not only were there no Stones around to be noticed by such a mainstream magazine, there is no way Consumer Reports would have given them the time of day even if they had been.</p>
<p>And speaking of Stone Brewing, we&#8217;re excited to release Stone Mixtape Vol. 6: Ashley&#8217;s 30th Anniversary Blend from them at the end of August. Stay tuned for more details about this exclusive beer, along with other brews from our friends on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Until then, know what&#8217;s in your glass &#8212; keep drinking real craft beer at Ashley&#8217;s!</p></blockquote>
