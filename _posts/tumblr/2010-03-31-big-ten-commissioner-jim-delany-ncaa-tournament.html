<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/tournament/2010/news/story?id=5043254">Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany: NCAA tournament expansion 'probable' - ESPN</a><br/><p>No, no, no. Please no. Sixty-four teams is good enough. I mean, the play-in game for the chance to lose to the tourney&#8217;s top seed is enough of a joke as is. We don&#8217;t need another 31 crappy teams. The comparison with football&#8217;s bowl system is weak because 6-6 teams don&#8217;t belong in postseason play, either. I get that it&#8217;s all about money, but this is ridiculous.</p>
