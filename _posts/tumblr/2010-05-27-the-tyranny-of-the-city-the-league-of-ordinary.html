<a href="http://www.ordinary-gentlemen.com/2010/05/the-tyranny-of-the-city/">The Tyranny of the City | The League of Ordinary Gentlemen</a><br/><p>"The question to me is not whether centers of power or culture or economy are good or bad, but whether there are appropriate checks and balances on their influence, and whether that influence then results in (cultural/political/economic) growth across the country or whether it simply saps the rest of the country of its resources."</p>
