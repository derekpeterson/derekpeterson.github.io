<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/10/education/10obama.html?hp">Obama Calls for U.S. to Again Lead Graduate Rates - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>Why don&#8217;t we instead focus on making an American public high school education worth something? Assuming that the number of per-capita college graduates is inherently important, wouldn&#8217;t that be a more effective response: to better prepare students to attend college? Of course, that assumption is absurd. The important economic goal is entrepreneurial ability and drive. Increasing the number of college graduates, on its own, does nothing to ensure that our economy with rise with it. Instead, it ensures (1) that college standards will degrade further and (2) that universities and student loan companies will continue to make money off of clueless students. The better way to help education spur economic growth is to improve the systems in place. Re-focus high schools to encourage creativity and entrepreneurship. Educate students about how to be discerning risk-takers and efficient decision-makers. Prepare our youth for a world filled with uncertainty by helping them develop the tools to understand and improve the part of the world under their control. Seeking higher college graduation rates for their own sake does none of this, and so is a fool&#8217;s proposition for re-building our economy.</p>
