title: Cochrane could argue that there must have been “real” factors at work, but
  unfortunately in both Argentina and America all the real factors were government
  policies he (rightly) loathes. Both countries grew rapidly in response to currency
  devaluation despite counterproductive statist policies. And those two examples are
  at least as relevant (or irrelevant) as Zimbabwe. Greece has both real and nominal
  problems, and thus is totally unlike Zimbabwe.
