<a href="http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/how-to-avoid-a-smartphones-bite/?hpw">How to Avoid a Smartphone's Bite - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>Seth Kugel proposes four categories of people, based on their need for being connected to the web: the Blissfully Disconnected, the Semi-Connected, the Moderates, the Power Users, and the Addicts. Personally, I know from experience that I&#8217;m a Semi-Connected person. When I&#8217;m abroad, I just don&#8217;t need to check my email or Facebook constantly, and free WiFi tends to work well enough for me. I do buy a local SIM card for my unlocked phone, but I never seem to actually use it much.</p>
