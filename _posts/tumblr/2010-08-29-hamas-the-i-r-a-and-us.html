<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/opinion/29abunimah.html">Hamas, the I.R.A., and Us</a><br/><p>A spot-on critique of George Mitchell and the Obama Administration&#8217;s comparisons between the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and those between the U.K. and the I.R.A. It&#8217;s obvious to everyone except those in power that the only way to reach a true peace agreement involves engaging with all parties in a fair and even-handed manner, just as we did with the terrorist I.R.A.</p>
