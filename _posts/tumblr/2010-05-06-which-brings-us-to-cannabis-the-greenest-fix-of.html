title: Which brings us to cannabis, the greenest fix of all. The same U.N. report
  finds that a square meter of marijuana cultivation can support 250 dose units of
  the drug. About the same amount of land—200,000 hectares—is under cultivation for
  cannabis, cocaine, and heroin around the world, but the cannabis is getting a heck
  of a lot more people high. For users in the United States, it also has the relative
  advantage of being produced in large quantities on American soil. About half of
  our marijuana supply comes from domestic sources—with minimal “drug miles” and a
  slimmer carbon footprint.
