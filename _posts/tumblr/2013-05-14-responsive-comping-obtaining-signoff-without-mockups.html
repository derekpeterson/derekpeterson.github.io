Designing in code sounds like the answer, but you may be mystified at where to begin, or feel unmoored and disoriented at the prospect of giving up the approach you&#8217;ve long relied on. Enter responsive comping. This new, mockup-less web design process makes it easy to get that Photoshop monkey off your back, and have a fresh new beginning with your old friend the web browser.</blockquote><p>Not sure if I&#8217;ve shared this link before, but I&#8217;ll be damned if it isn&#8217;t right.</p>
