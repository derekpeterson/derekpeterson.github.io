<a href="http://bevacqua.io/buildfirst">JavaScript Application Design #buildfirst</a><br/><p>I absolutely love this idea. It&#8217;s the direction I&#8217;ve started to move at work and with my own projects, so I will definitely be keeping an eye on this book.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Learn how to craft a workflow that increases your development productivity and reduces issues during deployments. Automate that workflow using Grunt, and master Continuous Development, Integration, and Deployment. Minimize manual labor, while keeping productivity in check.</p>
  
  <p>Concretely, the book teaches the importance of a Build Process, and once that&#8217;s out of the way, we will examine how to, using Grunt. Grunt is a Node.js-based task automation utility, equivalent to more widely known tools such as Make, or Ant. Grunt is more modern, faster to learn, and written in JavaScript, becoming an ideal choice for the book, which focuses on the process and the tasks, not just on the tooling.</p>
