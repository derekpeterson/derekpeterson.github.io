<p>I just happened across the Facebook profile of a girl from my freshman writing course. I remember her because she claimed in class that homosexuality was a choice and so does not deserve the same status as race or gender. I challenged her, and we argued for a bit until the instructor moved onto the next topic. Anyway, judging by her profile, she seems to have come around. Victory&#8217;s sweetness preserves well.</p>
