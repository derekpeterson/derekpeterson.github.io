<a href="http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=726">TPM: The Philosophers’ Magazine | Why I have no future</a><br/><p>Extremely interesting read. Galen Strawson proposes a view he calls &#8220;No Ownership of the Future&#8221; (or NOF): &#8220;My future life or experience doesn’t belong to me in such a way that it’s something that can be taken away from me. It can’t be thought of as possession in that way. To think that it’s something that can be taken away from me is like thinking that life could be deprived of life, or that something is taken away from an existing piece of string by the fact that it isn’t longer than it is. It’s just a mistake, like thinking that Paris is the capital of Argentina.&#8221;</p>

<p>For my part, I recognized it as obviously true. Now I have to puzzle out whether I am naturally episodic or diachronic. It&#8217;s hard, after all, to decide where intuition ends and desire begins.</p>
