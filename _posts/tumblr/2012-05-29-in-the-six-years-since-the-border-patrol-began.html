title: In the six years since the Border Patrol began expanding its presence on the
  peninsula, the number of apprehensions has declined by 27 percent — from 811 in
  2006 to 591 in 2011 — in the agency’s Blaine sector, which includes Western Washington,
  Oregon and Alaska. Border Patrol officials have said the decline is a success that
  validates their presence.

<p>This article perfectly illustrates the concepts of mission creep (how is the U.S.-Canadian border an issue in any way?) and of bureaucratic self-justification. There of course is no logical reason for Border Patrol to expand its operations along the Canadian border, but the bureaucracy will never fail to find reason to justify itself. It happens that apprehensions have declined, which provides evidence of USBP&#8217;s success, but apprehensions just as easily could have increased, providing just as useful evidence that USBP is needed now more than ever. No matter how reality plays out, the bureaucracy wins. It&#8217;s true of the DEA and the War on Drugs, of BP and the War on Immigration, and of the security apparatus and the War on Terrror.</p>
