I couldn&#8217;t activate my version of Windows 7 because I was using an upgrade disk to perform a clean installation. I called their toll-free number, thinking that it was just a matter of having them put something in their system that would allow me to do that. Instead, the customer support person told me that I would have to install Vista and then install 7 in order to activate the OS. Why would this seem like a good idea? I have a legitimate copy of Windows 7. I have a legitimate copy of Vista. Why make an actual paying customer go through this crap to help <i>you</i> protect against piracy? This is why you suck, Microsoft.</p>

<p>Anyway, this guide will help you activate Windows 7.</p>
