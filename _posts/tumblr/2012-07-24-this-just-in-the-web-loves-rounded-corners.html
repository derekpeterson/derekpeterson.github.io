<p>While doing my normal browsing this evening, I noticed something: every (non-news) site that I frequent has rounded corners. Once I noticed it and started looking for them, I realized that this is actually true. First up was <a href="https://xkcd.com/435/" target="_blank">xkcd</a>:</p>

<p>Then I saw the same thing on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/" target="_blank">reddit</a>:</p>

<p>Going back to Twitter to faithfully report on this observation, I saw:</p>

<p>And, of course, with <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap</a>'s popularity, that one was the kicker. But the web was not done. Tumblr is also cuckoo for rounded corners (albeit via an img tag, rather than CSS3; boo! hiss!):</p>

<p>All of which is to say nothing at all because, well, rounded corners are cool and elegant and beautiful. Still, don&#8217;t abandon the square. It has a lot to offer, with its strength and rigidity.</p>
