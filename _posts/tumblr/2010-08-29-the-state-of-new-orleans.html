<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/opinion/29liu.html">The State of New Orleans</a><br/><p>"Nearly 60 percent of Orleans Parish students now attend a public school that meets state standards, more than twice as many as did before Hurricane Katrina."</p>

<p>Given that Orleans Parish lost just under 100,000 residents (one-quarter of its population) because of Hurricane Katrina, I have to wonder whether the absolute change in the number of students attending such schools is as drastic as this number implies. It&#8217;s wonderful that 60% attend schools meeting the state standards, but some part of this jump has to come at the expense of some of the city&#8217;s poorest residents&#8217; permanent moves to other locales. I wish the authors gave more context.</p>
