title: Businesses and unions have already announced they will boycott travel to Arizona.
  The University of Arizona says it has already received notices from out-of-state
  students that they wonâ€™t be attending school there in the fall because of the law.
  There are calls for Major League Baseball to move the 2011 All-Star Game from Arizona,
  as the NFL once did with the Super Bowl after the state refused to honor the Martin
  Luther King Jr. holiday.
