</p><blockquote>You will often hear it said that JavaScript is a ‘functional’ programming language. It is described as such simply because functions are first-class values: many other features that define functional programming – immutable data, preference for recursion over looping, algebraic type systems, avoidance of side effects – are entirely absent. And while first-class functions are certainly useful, and enable users to program in functional style should they decide to, the notion that JS is functional often overlooks a core aspect of functional programming: programming with values.</blockquote>
