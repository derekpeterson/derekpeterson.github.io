Right now the system consists of individual boards that control each of the 15 public universities, which increases competition as well as redundancies. I agree with the viewpoint, and think a lot could be gained from centralizing some of the newer schools, although it would be foolish to push U of M under the same umbrella. It receives a smaller percentage of its funding from the state than do the other universities, and has a status apart from the others in terms of focus and prestige. I don&#8217;t know, but the same could potentially be said for MSU, too.</p>
