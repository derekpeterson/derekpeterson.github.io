title: Ms. Legge grew accustomed to the personal battering the changes wrought. She
  worried herself sick when the condo development was built behind her building, fearing

  painted the wall facing her back windows white, brightening her apartment. “It wasn’t
  as bad as I imagined,” she said. “At first there was total shock and fear, and then
  I accepted it. And now I can’t remember what was there before.”
