<a href="http://americancity.org/buzz/entry/3469/">Next American City » Buzz » As More Women Travel, Hotels Take Notice</a><br/><p>It seems that asking &#8220;are boutique rooms the answer to making travel better for women?&#8221; is to answer the question. This seems silly. I&#8217;m with MaryBeth Bond when she says </p><blockquote>“I have seen the hotel industry cater subtly to women without being patronizing, for example by putting shower caps and nail files in the room, and adding a room service menu expanded beyond hamburger and fries to include a big salad.”</blockquote>

Why not just create a better hotel experience, rather than treating women as dainty children who require some sort of princess experience?
