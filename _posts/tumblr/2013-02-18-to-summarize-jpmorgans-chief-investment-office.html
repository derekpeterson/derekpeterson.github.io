title: 'To summarize: JPMorgan’s Chief Investment Office needed a new value-at-risk
  (VaR) model for the synthetic credit portfolio (the one that blew up) and assigned
  a quantitative whiz (“a London-based quantitative expert, mathematician and model
  developer” who previously worked at a company that built analytical models) to create
  it. The new model “operated through a series of Excel spreadsheets, which had to
  be completed manually, by a process of copying and pasting data from one spreadsheet
  to another.”'
