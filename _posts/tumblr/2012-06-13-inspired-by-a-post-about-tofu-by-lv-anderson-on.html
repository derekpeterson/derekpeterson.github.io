  Inspired by a post about tofu by LV Anderson on Slate’s Brow Beat blog, I went a-searching for photos of my own (successful!) tofu banh mi effort. I came up empty-handed online, so I figured I would stick one on the interwebz.

  On the sandwich, I’m not one not to tinker, so my version had guacamole in place of avacado and a carrot-and-onion slaw without cabbage.
