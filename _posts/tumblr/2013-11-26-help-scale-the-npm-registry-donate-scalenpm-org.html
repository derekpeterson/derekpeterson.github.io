<a href="https://scalenpm.org/">Help scale the npm registry - donate | scalenpm.org</a><br/><blockquote class="link_og_blockquote"> We’re a startup. We run npm because we love node and we’re very well qualified for the job. But in the last year, npm has become a giant beast of a project. We run it lean, both from an engineering and hardware perspective, because it’s just too expensive to do otherwise.

We wondered, how could we possibly get the money for the hardware and engineers to do this the right way and keep it free for the community?

That’s where you come in!</blockquote>
