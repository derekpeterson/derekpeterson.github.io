<p>Poll on the right-hand side of my Facebook homepage just now:</p>

<p>What kind of beer does the Most Interesting Man in the World prefer?</p>

<p>a.) Dos Equis<br/>
b.) Bud Light<br/>
c.) Guinness<br/>
d.) Heineken<br/>
e.) Don&#8217;t Know</p>

<p>I understand why they left out &#8216;none of the above,&#8217; but this is silly. The Most Interesting Man in the World wouldn&#8217;t be a corporate whore for international hops-flavored water companies. Guinness is the only remotely drinkable option on this list (I have to take that on faith from people who have had it in Dublin).</p>

<p>Clearly the algorithm indicated that I would be the ideal audience for this poll. Why? I list craft beer as an interest and have posted about my home-brews. Oh, wait, that would make me exactly the opposite of the target audience for this poll and the ads that would infect my Facebook experience from now on. Shucks. In fact, it just reminded me that my using Facebook gives these purveyors of hops-flavored water a lot of information about my Internet habits. Naturally, that makes me unhappy. Bottom line? Facebook, you suck at ad-targeting.</p>
