<a href="http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1">Got 15 minutes and want to learn Git? - Code School - Try Git</a><br/><p>Neat little interactive guide. Check it out if you&#8217;ve been meaning to start using Git (which you should be doing!).</p>

<p>Also, GitHub is awesome. As a website, of course, but also as an organization.</p>
