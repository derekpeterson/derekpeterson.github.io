  <p>On a rainy morning I found myself sitting at my desk thinking about efficient working. Before I started as a freelancer, I had some days where I worked a lot but was never happy with the result. I started with Zen practice back in 2006. What came to my mind after a good while was: the old Zen masters already knew hundreds of years ago, how today’s programmers should work. Even though I don’t like these “be a better programmer” posts, I want to outline some of my thoughts from that time.</p>
