<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/10/us/politics/obama-news-conference.html?hp&_r=0">Obama Offers Plan Meant to Ease Concerns on Surveillance</a><br/><blockquote>President Obama [released] new information about spying activities and [called] for changes aimed at bolstering public confidence that the programs do not intrude too far into Americans’ privacy.</blockquote>

ARG. The problem is not the extent of the intrusion. It is the intrusion itself. Without any kind of justification for such programs (beyond &#8220;Trust us. You&#8217;re safer.&#8221;), there can be no legitimate safeguards. What does a safeguard for an extralegal activity even entail? All I see is hand-waving.

<blockquote>It’s not enough for me, as president, to have confidence in these programs. The American people need to have confidence in them as well.</blockquote>

And that&#8217;s just laughable. He *ran* on opening up the government and restoring the rule of law, and yet here we are five years in with an even more secretive government that relies even more on confidential legal memos as the justification for blatantly illegal activities.
