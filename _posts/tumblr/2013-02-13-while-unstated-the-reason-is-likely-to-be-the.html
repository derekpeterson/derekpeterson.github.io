title: While unstated, the reason is likely to be the growing WebKit monoculture,
  especially on the mobile platforms where Opera is most widely used. Android and
  iOS both use WebKit-powered browsers. Content on the mobile Web is widely designed
  for WebKit alone, and many sites depend explicitly on WebKit-proprietary features.
  This is often the case even when standard, browser-independent equivalent features
  are available. The result of this is that Opera users can be left behind, faced
  with sites that don’t display correctly—even though, with a modicum of care and
  attention on the part of Web developers, the content should work fine.
