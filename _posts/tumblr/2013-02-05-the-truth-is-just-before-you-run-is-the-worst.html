title: The truth is, just before you run is the worst possible moment to try to explain
  to someone, or even to yourself, why you run. It just doesnâ€™t make sense. Running
  is hard. It requires effort. And after all the pain you usually end up right back
  where you started, having run in a big, pointless circle.
