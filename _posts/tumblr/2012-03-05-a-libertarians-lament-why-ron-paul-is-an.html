<a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/94477/ron-paul-distorted-libertarian-ideology">A Libertarian’s Lament: Why Ron Paul Is An Embarrassment To The Creed | The New Republic</a><br/><p>Just dug up this fantastic Will Wilkinson piece. Granted that Rep. Paul&#8217;s star shines less brightly with each and every primary loss to the equally abysmal Rick Santorum and the phantom Mitt Romney, but it is still good to note that Ron Paul is even more horrifying to many libertarians than he is to the general public.</p>
