<a href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2013/11/28/emotional-programming/">Emotional Programming in Open Source | Armin Ronacher's Thoughts and Writings</a><br/><p>A really honest post from Armin Ronacher (creator of Flask, Jinja, Werkzeug, etc.) on the double-edged sword that passion represents in open-source software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found it quite hard this year to work on my own projects because the bug trackers were full of things I personally did not really care about. The things I wrote over the last few years all work so well for me, that I don&#8217;t need to fix problems or add things. When there is something that needs fixing, I will work on it, but otherwise I don&#8217;t necessarily get the motivation to work on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also wrote the following, which made me appreciate better that software rock stars are still just people writing software to solve problems that they see.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The unfortunate truth is that some things in my life started acting on their own without me having much control over it. Somehow it happened that on PyPI I am (was?) one of the authors with the most downloads and split across multiple projects and that sort-of happened by itself.</p>
