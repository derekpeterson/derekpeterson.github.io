title: While the failure of the “war on drugs” is an oft-rehashed theme, the NDTA

  production in Mexico. Apparently the costs resulting from lost productivity associated
  with drug abuse, the burden on the justice system, and the environmental impact
  of drug production are a staggering $215 billion.
