<p>I found myself in a situation today in which I had one perfectly ripe avocado, yet only a few of the other ingredients for my guacamole (the best guacamole). So, I winged it and tried something different.</p>

<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
<ul><li>One avocado</li>
<li>One red bell pepper (in place of roma tomato)</li>
<li>One-quarter of a small yellow onion (in place of red onion)</li>
<li>Cumin, salt, powdered ginger, and rice vinegar (in place of lime juice) to taste</li>
</ul><p>Mash the avocado. Dice the onion and pepper. Add them to the mashed avocado and combine. Add the seasonings and vinegar to taste.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it. My thinking was that I would make something vaguely Asian (Japanese, specifically, as a topping for rolls), using rice vinegar in place of lime juice alongside the ginger. But, to really follow through on that would mean replacing the yellow onion with green onion, adding an East Asian pepper in place of the missing serrano chili, and coming up with a better replacement for tomato than the bell pepper (for consistency, not because of poor performance). This tastes pretty good on this hot and humid summer day, though.</p>
