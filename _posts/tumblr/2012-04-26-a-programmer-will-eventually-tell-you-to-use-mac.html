title: A programmer will eventually tell you to use Mac OSX or Linux. If the programmer
  likes fonts and typography, they’ll tell you to get a Mac OSX computer. If they
  like control and have a huge beard, they’ll tell you to install Linux. Again, use
  whatever computer you have right now that works. All you need is gedit, a Terminal,
  and python.

<p>From the &#8220;Warnings for Beginners&#8221; section of &#8220;Learn Python the Hard Way&#8221;. I know my way around Vim, am familiar with Linux, work on Mac OS X, and have occasionally been known to wear a beard, but this made me laugh.</p>
