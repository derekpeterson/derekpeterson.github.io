<p>It seems remarkable to me that we never offered streamlined visas for Iraqi citizens to come to the United States, study or work, send money home, and return to Iraq to help re-build the country. Maybe by now the country would have some solution to the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/elections/index.html?scp=5&amp;sq=iraqi%20parliament&amp;st=cse" target="_blank">dysfunctional parliament</a> and <a href="http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-06-27/opinion/21928142_1_iraqi-democracy-reconstruction-funds-corruption" target="_blank">rampant corruption</a> plaguing the country. On the other hand, given the state of our own government with its corruption and dysfunction, it may have been best to arrange for Canada to accept them.</p>
