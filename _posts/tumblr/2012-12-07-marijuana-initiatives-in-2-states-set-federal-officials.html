<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/us/marijuana-initiatives-in-2-states-set-federal-officials-scrambling.html">Marijuana Initiatives in 2 States Set Federal Officials Scrambling - NYTimes.com</a><br/><blockquote>“In enacting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance,” she said. “Regardless of any changes in state law, including the change that will go into effect on December 6 in Washington State, growing, selling or possessing any amount of marijuana remains illegal under federal law.”</blockquote>

The deferral to the Controlled Substances Act is garbage: the Obama Administration has used the executive power not to enforce existing laws in refusing to argue DOMA cases and enacting the deferred action policy. There is no obligation to pursue these cases, but of course the same has been true of the Obama Justice Department&#8217;s overzealous crackdowns on medical marijuana facilities for the last four years. Instead, the point is to emphasize the federal government&#8217;s supremacy over people&#8217;s will.

<blockquote>Some law enforcement officials, <em>alarmed at the prospect that marijuana users in both states could get used to flouting federal law openly</em>, are said to be pushing for a stern response.</blockquote>

(NB: I don&#8217;t smoke, but that&#8217;s not the point.)
