<a href="http://jameso.be/2013/11/16/good-tests.html">Good tests, bad tests</a><br/><p>This is a solid blog post on testing (e.g., why to do it, what strategy to take), with a walk through a basic Python module and a few approaches to testing it. It also makes good points about what (pseudo-) privacy in dynamic languages and the effect that should have on writing tests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Privacy in dynamic languages like Python and Ruby should be shown even more reverence than in static languages like Java where the concept is codified with reserved words and compiler enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[&#8230;]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Testing the private attributes of a class or module impose the same sort of burdens as not declaring a minimal public interface. When you test private attributes, you codify not only the expected behavior, but the implementation details of your module into tests.</p>
