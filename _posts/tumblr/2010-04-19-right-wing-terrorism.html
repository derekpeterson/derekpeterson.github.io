<p>Watching Meet the Press yesterday, I saw David Gregory search for the word to describe Timothy McVeigh. He hesitated before deciding to call him an anti-government &#8220;person.&#8221; Of course, that doesn&#8217;t fit. McVeigh was an anti-government, right-wing <b><i>terrorist</i></b>. For some reason I doubt that he would have the same reluctance to call Umar Abdulmutallab, the <i>failed</i> underpants bomber, a terrorist. That&#8217;s the state of the supposedly left-wing mainstream media, though. From the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36595396/ns/meet_the_press/page/4/" target="_blank">transcript</a>:</p>

<p>"MR. GREGORY: But, Congresswoman, is that&#8212;do these kinds of words, we are&#8212;April 19th is coming up, is the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, where an anti-government, you know, person, who was arguably a sociopath&#8230;"</p>
