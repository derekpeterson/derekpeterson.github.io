<a href="http://rijksmuseum.github.io/">Rijksmuseum API</a><br/><blockquote>
  <p>The live website API (which has a live link to the website platform) makes the full power of the award-winning Rijksmuseum website directly accessible to a large group of developers. Searching the collection is one activity that offers a wide range of interesting options. The same is true of the “explore the collection” pages, the Rijksstudio users’ collections, and the tiled images used to zoom in to tight close-ups of works of art. Calendar information is also available, for example. The JSON-based service is so simple that, in no time at all, you can build something that makes use of the Rijksmuseum’s rich and attractive content.</p>
