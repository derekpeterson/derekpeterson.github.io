<a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/04/04/shyness/">Shyness - The Boston Globe</a><br/><p>An excellent article, though I think Mr. Parker meant to write about <i>introversion</i> rather than shyness.</p>

<p>My favorite line: &#8220;Shyness is a tribute paid to the gravity of human interaction, a proper dread at the fact of other people: their closeness, the weight of their existence, their power to hurt, and our power to hurt them.&#8221; Hear, hear!</p>
