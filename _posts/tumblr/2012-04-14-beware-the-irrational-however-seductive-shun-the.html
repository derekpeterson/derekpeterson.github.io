title: Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the ‘transcendent’ and all who
  invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity
  for yourself and others. Don’t be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture
  all experts as they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity.
  Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty
  of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for
  others any more than you would expect others to live for your.
