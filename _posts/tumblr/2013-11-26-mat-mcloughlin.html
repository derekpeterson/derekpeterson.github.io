<a href="http://mat-mcloughlin.net/2013/11/26/dark-matter-developers-do-not-equal-bad-developers.html">Mat McLoughlin</a><br/><blockquote class="link_og_blockquote"> [Dark matter developers] aren’t the first to answer Stack Overflow questions, they don’t have their own blog and they don’t go to conferences. What they do, do is get stuff done and at the end of the day go home and live their lives. It’s important to remember this doesn’t make them bad. They may still know the latest design patterns, tools and techniques just as well as you do. They just choose not to talk about it. </blockquote>
