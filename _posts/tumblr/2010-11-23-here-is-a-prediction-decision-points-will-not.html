<blockquote>Here is a prediction: “Decision Points” will not endure. Its prose aims for tough-minded simplicity but keeps landing on simpleminded sententiousness.</blockquote>&#8212;<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2010/11/29/101129crbo_books_packer?currentPage=all" target="_blank">The Presidential memoirs of George W.

<p>Mr. Packer has an excellent review of former President Bush&#8217;s memoir. Read it, read it, read it.</p>
