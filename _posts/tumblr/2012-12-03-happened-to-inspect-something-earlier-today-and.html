title: Happened to inspect something earlier today and noticed a new web developers
  toolset in Firefox Nightly. Much nicer with the integrated console and inspector,
  rather than having to open each separately and give up window space. I am happy
  to see Mozilla continue to make strides with Firefox and feel as confident as ever
  that it will be able to reach parity with Chrome.
