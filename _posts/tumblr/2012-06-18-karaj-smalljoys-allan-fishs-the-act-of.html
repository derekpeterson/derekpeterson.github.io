  Allan Fish’s “The Act of Drinking Beer with Friends is the Highest Form of Art” ca. 1970, from the Lucy Lippard papers. 
  Wherein artist Tom Marioni (initially under the name Allan Fish) brings together friends and artists to talk about art and drink beer.  Original gatherings took place in his studio; the last gathering was held at SFMOMA in 2009.
