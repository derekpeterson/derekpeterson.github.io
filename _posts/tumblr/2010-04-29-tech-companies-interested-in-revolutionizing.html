<p>Tech companies interested in revolutionizing business to make it more about satisfying customers and creating efficiency should get into banking. I can&#8217;t think of any other industry in which the entire setup aims to screw the customer in every way possible. To paraphrase John Ensign during the Senate Finance Committee&#8217;s recent grilling of Goldman&#8217;s executives, at least casinos tell their customers that the house always wins.</p>
