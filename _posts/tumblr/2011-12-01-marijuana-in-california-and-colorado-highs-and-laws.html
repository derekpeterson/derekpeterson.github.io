<a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21541065">Marijuana in California and Colorado: Highs and laws | The Economist</a><br/><p>Here&#8217;s hoping the Obama administration calls off the dogs and lets Colorado opt out of this particularly disgusting and destructive part of the War on Drugs, which punishes users of a substance that is less dangerous than alcohol or tobacco. I won&#8217;t get my hopes up, though. There&#8217;s always 2012, after all, and why would Barack want to open himself up to being called soft on drugs?</p>
