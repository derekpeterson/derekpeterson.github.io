<p>I&#8217;m only just getting started on this web development and kinda sorta freelancing route, and this was a fantastic video to watch as a newbie. Getting and interacting with clients is an intimidating prospect. It helps to have a community elder to describe exactly how things should happen, what to do when they don&#8217;t happen that way, and the confidence that you have to have in your own work.</p>
