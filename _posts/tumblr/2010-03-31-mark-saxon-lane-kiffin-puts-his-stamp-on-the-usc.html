<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/ncf/columns/story?id=5042705">Mark Saxon: Lane Kiffin puts his stamp on the USC Trojans right away - ESPN Los Angeles</a><br/><p>In my despair about the state of Michigan sports, I almost forgot to be excited that USC hired Lane Kiffin as its new football coach. It&#8217;s great to be a USC hater with this joke running the program.</p>
