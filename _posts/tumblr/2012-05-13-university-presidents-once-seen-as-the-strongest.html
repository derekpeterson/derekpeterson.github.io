title: University presidents, once seen as the strongest forces for limiting athletic
  expansion, are now promoting it. As state funding for higher education has plummeted,
  presidents have become their schools’ head cheerleaders. They have learned that
  nothing raises a school’s profile, attracts out-of-state students and rallies alumni
  like a winning football team. A playoff might enable more schools to take turns
  on the biggest stage.
