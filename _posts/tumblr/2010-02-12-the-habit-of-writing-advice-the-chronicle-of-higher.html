<a href="http://chronicle.com/article/The-Habit-of-Writing/64001/">The Habit of Writing - Advice - The Chronicle of Higher Education</a><br/><p>Column about writing and running, with reflections on habits and how they help us do both.</p>
<p>"The friend who introduced me to running, a biologist at Duke University, once said that serious runners never ask themselves if they&#8217;re going to run. The answer to that is always yes. The only questions are where, when, and with whom. Discipline becomes practice becomes habit. It&#8217;s a lot harder to break habits."</p>
