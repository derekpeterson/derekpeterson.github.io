title: I said that I had talked to two lawyers and they said it was really a weird
  case because no one knows if he can be charged with assault and battery while working
  in that job. But I told her, that some of my lawyer friends really wanted to find
  out. She said, “Well, we’re very new to this job …” and I said, “Yeah, so we need
  these test cases to find out where you stand.”

<p>An altogether interesting story about Penn&#8217;s experience calling the police on the TSA agent who assaulted him. He has good advice at the end, too. Namely, complain. The TSA&#8217;s practices are unnecessary, humiliating, and should be illegal.</p>
