<p>I bought a Bodum French press coffee-maker (1-liter Kenya model; highly recommended) from Amazon two weeks ago. That tells them that I like coffee. So, naturally they would tailor recommendations for me based on this recent purchase. That&#8217;s only logical. What did I just receive? One of their &#8220;you might also like to buy&#8221; emails that featured <i>Bodum coffee-makers</i>. Why would the algorithm suggest that that&#8217;s a relevant line of products to offer me? I have no idea. I understand that they don&#8217;t sell many coffee-related products outside of coffee-makers, which puts a natural limit on the number of connections they can make between my recent coffee-maker purchase and other products. But why suggest that I buy what I just bought? Why doesn&#8217;t Amazon&#8217;s recommendation algorithm have an anti-circularity feature? Why not just recommend that I buy a toaster to accompany my French press?</p>
