<a href="http://ejohn.org/blog/webkit-is-the-jquery-of-browser-engines/">John Resig - WebKit is the jQuery of Browser Engines</a><br/><p>John Resig argues that the Opeara switch isn&#8217;t bad and may in fact be good. He concedes that Opera may have less pull when it comes to standards, which I think is one of the bigger issues here, but that that isn&#8217;t necessarily the case. I guess we&#8217;ll see.</p>
