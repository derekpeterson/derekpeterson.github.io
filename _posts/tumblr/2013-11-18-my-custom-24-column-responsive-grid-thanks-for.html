<blockquote>
  <p>WHY?
  I was working a late night on a project and decided to investigate some general frameworks and twitter bootstrap was appearing on all the blogs, plus I had heard a lot, good and bad, about it. With the majority of reviews being good; I decided to download it and give it a try.</p>
