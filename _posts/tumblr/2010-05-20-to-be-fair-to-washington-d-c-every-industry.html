title: To be fair to Washington, D.C., every industry town frowns upon, for example,
  singling out a colleague or personal acquaintance for public criticism. In Washington,
  D.C., the special problem is that magazines, think tanks, and political discourse
  generally require forceful disagreements, intellectual honesty, a self-conscious
  tension of being part of something and apart from it, and staffers with a willingness
  to be persuaded, following reason and evidence where they lead.
