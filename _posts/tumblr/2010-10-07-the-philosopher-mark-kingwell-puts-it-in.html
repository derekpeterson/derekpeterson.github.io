title: 'The philosopher Mark Kingwell puts it in existential terms: “Procrastination
  most often arises from a sense that there is too much to do, and hence no single
  aspect of the to-do worth doing… . Underneath this rather antic form of action-as-inaction
  is the much more unsettling question whether anything is worth doing at all.” In
  that sense, it might be useful to think about two kinds of procrastination: the
  kind that is genuinely akratic and the kind that’s telling you that what you’re
  supposed to be doing has, deep down, no real point. The procrastinator’s challenge,
  and perhaps the philosopher’s, too, is to figure out which is which.'
