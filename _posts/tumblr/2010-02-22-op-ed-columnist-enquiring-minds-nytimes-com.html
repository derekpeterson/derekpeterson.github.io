<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/21/opinion/22douthat.html?hp">Op-Ed Columnist - Enquiring Minds - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>It feels weird, but I&#8217;m with Douthat on this one. In fact, I shared a similar sentiment on Google Reader last month in response to an ANIMAL <a href="http://animalnewyork.com/2010/01/rumor-john-edwards-has-a-sex-tape-monster-dong/" target="_blank">post</a>: &#8220;<span class="entry-comment-content">I hate celebrity gossip, but love political gossip that proves how similar politicians are to celebrities. Woo! Megalomaniacal democracy!&#8221;</span></p>
