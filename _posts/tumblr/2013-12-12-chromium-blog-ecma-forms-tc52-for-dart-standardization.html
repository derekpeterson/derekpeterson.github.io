<a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2013/12/ecma-forms-tc52-for-dart-standardization.html">Chromium Blog: Ecma forms TC52 for Dart Standardization</a><br/><p>Press release copied in whole:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week Ecma created a new technical committee named TC52 to publish a standard specification of the Dart language. We’re excited about this milestone in the evolution of Dart and the web.</p>
  
  <p>Dart is ready for standardization. As of last month’s 1.0 SDK release, Dart is now officially stable and mature enough for production use. We’ll be collaborating with the broader web community via TC52 to responsibly evolve the language going forward.</p>
  
  <p>The new standardization process is an important step towards a future where Dart runs natively in web browsers. Dart apps can be fast when compiled to JavaScript, but an embedded Dart VM enables even better performance.</p>
  
  <p>We&#8217;re thrilled to have a dedicated technical committee working on Dart. We also feel confident that Ecma—the home of standards such as JavaScript, Eiffel, and C#—is the right place to help guide the evolution of the Dart language. If you’d like to get involved, please join the committee.</p>
