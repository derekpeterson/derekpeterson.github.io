<p>Please just make Tim Tebow go away. I don&#8217;t want to read about how he is &#8220;an enigma&#8221; or &#8220;an awesome leader&#8221; or &#8220;a guy who totally gives everything back to the community (even his DNA to make lots of little Timmy Tebows).&#8221; I may like to read an article about his religious nuttiness, but only if has lots of snark.</p>
