title: 'Going forward, here’s a topic I’m trying to write about for the new show:
  the idea of, “Why do we want what we can’t have? Why does disinterest cause attraction?”
  Isn’t that so frustrating? As Woody Allen says in Annie Hall, “I would never want
  to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member.” I really hate
  that we are built that way, and want to learn more about it.'
