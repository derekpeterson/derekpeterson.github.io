          New York City <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2013/04/idea-of-the-week-inequality-and-new-yorks-subway.html" target="_blank">has a problem with income inequality</a>. And it’s getting worse—the top of the spectrum is gaining and the bottom is losing. Along individual subway lines, earnings range from poverty to considerable wealth. The interactive infographic here charts these shifts, using data on median household income, from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/american_community_survey_acs/cb12-175.html" target="_blank">U.S. Census Bureau</a>, for census tracts with subway stations.
