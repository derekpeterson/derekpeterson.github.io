<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=5092774">NCAA bans eye black with messages, wedge blocks on kickoffs, toughens taunting penalty for 2011 - ESPN</a><br/><p>Right. Ban the stupid eye black messages just as Tebow, the most visible offender, leaves for the NFL. Clearly they considered this a good idea only coincidentally at the same time as The Proselytizer graduates.</p>
