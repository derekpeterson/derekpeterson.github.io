title: The matter of the sheer scale of Detroit is worth noting again. Youngstown
  has a lot of great things going on, and I believe is on the right track. But it
  strikes me that a place like Youngstown is unlikely to attract many of the truly
  audacious dreamers that don’t have a pre-existing connection to the place. When
  you want to take on that challenge, it’s a city like Detroit or New Orleans that
  has the powerful brand to be a draw. I think this powerful brand is a huge asset
  of Detroit, a city known around the world.
