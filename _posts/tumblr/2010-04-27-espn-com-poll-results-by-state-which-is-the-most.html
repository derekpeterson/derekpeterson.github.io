<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/fp/flashPollResultsState?sportIndex=frontpage&pollId=90041">ESPN.com Poll Results by State: Which is the most dramatic setting in the decisive game of a playoff series?</a><br/><p>An ESPN SportsNation poll that actually makes sense. I &#8230; don&#8217;t understand. Since when do these people make sense? Also, the Bible Belt clearly doesn&#8217;t understand dramatic moments. The NBA over the NHL? We&#8217;re talking sudden death, people!</p>
