title: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently calculated
  how much each affluent country spends on social programs. When you include both
  direct spending and tax expenditures, the U.S. has one of the biggest welfare states
  in the world. We rank behind Sweden and ahead of Italy, Austria, the Netherlands,
  Denmark, Finland and Canada. Social spending in the U.S. is far above the organization’s
  average.
