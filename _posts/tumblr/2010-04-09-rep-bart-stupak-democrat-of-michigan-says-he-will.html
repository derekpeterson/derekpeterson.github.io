Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, Says He Will Not Seek Re-election in November 2010 - NYTimes.com</a><br/><p>Wow, for being the scourge of the petulant right, Stupak has really sold the left down the river. He scuttled a superior health care bill, forced Obama to write an unnecessarily strong executive order prohibiting federal funds from funding a certain medical procedure, and now will hand over a seat to the Republicans.</p>
