<p>Why, I never:</p>

<p>"Michael Doughney registered the domain name peta.org in 1995 and created a website called "People Eating Tasty Animals". The site described itself as "a resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting and the fruits of scientific research". &#8230; The circuit court affirmed the district&#8217;s court ruling, which had granted summary judgment to PETA. However, the court denied PETA&#8217;s cross-appeal for attorney&#8217;s fees and costs, because <b>it held that Doughney&#8217;s action was not malicious</b>.&#8221;</p>
