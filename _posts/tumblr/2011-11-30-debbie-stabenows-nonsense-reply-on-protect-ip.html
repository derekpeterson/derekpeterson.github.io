I contacted her office two weeks ago asking her to vote against the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act and received this today:

<blockquote><p>Thank you for contacting me about your concerns with legislation designed to fight Internet piracy. I appreciate hearing from you.</p>

<p>I believe that in a globally-competitive environment, it is more important than ever to balance both public and private rights to support innovation and creativity.</p>

<p>As you may know, the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property (PROTECT IP) Act was introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy on May 12, 2011. This legislation would penalize Internet sites that engage in the unlawful sharing or sale of counterfeit goods or services, which range from new movie and music releases, to pharmaceuticals and consumer products. I will keep your position on this bill in mind as it moves through the legislative process.</p>

<p>Thank you again for contacting me. Please continue to keep me informed about issues of concern to you and your family.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Debbie Stabenow</p>
<p>United States Senator</p></blockquote>

Oh, ok. Well, I&#8217;m glad that you seem to really grasp the issues at hand. I&#8217;ll file this right alongside Carl Levin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/29/senate-votes-to-let-military-detain-americans-indefinitely_n_1119473.html" target="_blank">"crafting" of a measure to allow the military to indefinitely detain American citizens</a> as the reasons why I won&#8217;t be voting for either of Michigan&#8217;s incumbent senators in the future. And, to think, that I actually canvassed for Levin.
