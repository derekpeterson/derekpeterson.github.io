title: When you’re young, you always feel that life hasn’t yet begun — that “life”
  is always scheduled to begin next week, next month, next year, after the holidays
  — whenever. But then suddenly you’re old and the scheduled life didn’t arrive. You
  find yourself asking, ‘Well then, exactly what was it I was having — that interlude
  — the scrambly madness — all that time I had before?
