<a href="http://www.thepaypalblog.co/2012/07/statement-on-nytimes.html">Statement on New York Times Investigation</a><br/><p>Pretty wild double-speak used by PayPal&#8217;s Michael Barrett in this post. I am having a hard time reconciling this: 

</p><blockquote>Following the WikiLeaks account restriction in December 2010, we were approached by the U.S. State Department to join a task force to conduct a long term investigation of the New York Times.  The task force was created to specifically investigate articles the New York Times published in conjunction with WikiLeaks.</blockquote>

with this:

<blockquote>we at PayPal believe it is right to stand up for journalism, no matter the cost.</blockquote>

Wouldn&#8217;t standing up for journalism logically entail resisting a government&#8217;s effort to investigate and censor a newspaper for, uh, journalism? I think so.
