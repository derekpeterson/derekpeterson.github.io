title: 1. Johan Franzen’s franchise-record six points in a playoff game Thursday night
  added to his growing reputation for being clutch come spring time. The 30-year-old
  Swede now has 35 goals and 68 points in 74 playoff games — all since the 2004-05
  lockout. This guy just plain loves playoff hockey. Detroit coach Mike Babcock got
  him going Thursday by taking him off Pavel Datsyuk’s line and putting him with Henrik
  Zetterberg and Todd Bertuzzi. All the line did was combine for 13 points in the
  7-1 rout over San Jose. Now that’s coaching.
