  "Unfortunately, I’ve been through this a lot, and I pretty much have it down to a science when President Obama will visit Colorado, when he will meet with the families of those who lost loved ones, and when he will give his big speech that people will call ‘unifying’ and ‘very presidential,’" Jacksonville resident Amy Brennen, 32, said, speaking for every other person in the country. "Nothing really surprises me when it comes to this kind of thing anymore. And that makes me feel terrible."

  "Oh, and here’s another thing I hate I know," Brennen continued, "In exactly two weeks this will all be over and it will be like it never happened."

<p>One of those times when The Onion puts it better than the actual news. It&#8217;s brash, sure, but no less so than NPR including a piece on how the shooting will impact the weekend box office of The Dark Knight Rises on All Things Considered yesterday.</p>
